## Introduction
NServer is a Python framework for building customised DNS name servers with a focuses on ease of use over completeness. It implements high level APIs for interacting with DNS queries whilst making very few assumptions about how responses are generated.

It is not intended to act like traditional DNS servers such as [BIND](https://www.isc.org/bind/) or [CoreDNS](https://github.com/coredns/coredns) and should not be considered a general DNS resolver.

NServer has been built upon [dnslib](https://github.com/paulc/dnslib) however uses high level abstractions that does not give access to the full DNS specification. If this is your desired behaviour I suggest using dnslib and its [server API](https://github.com/paulc/dnslib/blob/master/dnslib/server.py).

NServer has been inspired by easy to use high level frameworks such as [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) or [Requests](https://github.com/psf/requests).

!!! warning
    NServer is currently Beta software and does not have complete documentation, testing, or implementation of certain features.


## Features

- **Flexibility:** Receive and respond to DNS queries using python functions
- **Speed:** comfortably handle 1000 queries per second on a single thread
- **Protocols:** supports UDP, TCP DNS queries
  - TCP server support request pipelining and connection multiplexing
- **Development:** fully typed for your static analysis / linting needs

## Quick Start

Follow our [Quickstart Guide](quickstart.md).

```python title="tldr.py"
from nserver import NameServer, Query, A

server = NameServer("example")

@server.rule("example.com", ["A"])
def example_a_records(query: Query):
    return A(query.name, "1.2.3.4")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server.run()
```

```bash
nserver --server tldr.py:server
```
